We've chosen to recreate and update the classic Minesweeper.
We researched and defined what made the design of the original Minesweeper, and found it was the tension and release of finding a trail of safe spots in the grid.
Then we explored how Minesweeper would evolve if the player controlled a persistent character rather than a curser.
This allowed us to expand on the theme and overall character of the game, turning it instead into a civilian rescue mission.

Our protagonist, John Handyman -- a balding but charming middle aged man finds himself in a predicament. Rescue a sunbaking floppy-hatted young man from a minefield, or 
leave and return to his holiday in paraguay.
A real trolley problem.
